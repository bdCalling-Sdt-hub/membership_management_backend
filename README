Stack: ExpressJS, MongoDB

Clean Up:
- remove otp from responses. src/controllers/user.ts

Improvements:
- Instead of keep creating OTPs untill we finally save a unique OTP, we can save it like this format: "user@email.com:615243"

Todos:
- Build tools tab apis
- Build profile tab apis
- tools video/file page pagination

Bug:
- tools/upload. after file upload, the secure url doesn't work
