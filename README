Stack: ExpressJS, MongoDB

Chores:
- /update-password is not secure, fix it
- /validate-otp should respond with JWT for security

Clean Up:
- remove otp from responses. src/controllers/user.ts

Improvements:
- Instead of keep creating OTPs untill we finally save a unique OTP, we can save it like this format: "user@email.com:615243"
